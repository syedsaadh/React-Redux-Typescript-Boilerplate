# TypeScript React Redux Starter

This quick start guide will teach you how to wire up TypeScript with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
By the end, you'll have

* a project with React and TypeScript
* linting with [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)
* testing with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/), and
* state management with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux)

We'll use the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool to quickly get set up.

We assume that you're already using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
You may also want to get a sense of [the basics with React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html).

# Clone project and Install dependencies

We'll create a new project called `my-app`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/syedsaadh/React-Redux-Typescript-Boilerplate.git my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

At this point, your project layout should look like the following:

```text
my-app/
├─ .gitignore
├─ node_modules/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│  └─ ...
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
└─ tslint.json
```

Of note:

* `tsconfig.json` contains TypeScript-specific options for our project.
* `tslint.json` stores the settings that our linter, [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), will use.
* `package.json` contains our dependencies, as well as some shortcuts for commands we'd like to run for testing, previewing, and deploying our app.
* `public` contains static assets like the HTML page we're planning to deploy to, or images. You can delete any file in this folder apart from `index.html`.
* `src` contains our TypeScript and CSS code. `index.tsx` is the entry-point for our file, and is mandatory.

# Running the project

Running the project is as simple as running

```sh
npm run start
```

This runs the `start` script specified in our `package.json`, and will spawn off a server which reloads the page as we save our files.
Typically the server runs at `http://localhost:3000`, but should be automatically opened for you.

This tightens the iteration loop by allowing us to quickly preview changes.

# Testing the project

Testing is also just a command away:

```sh
npm run test
```

This command runs Jest, an incredibly useful testing utility, against all files whose extensions end in `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`.
Like with the `npm run start` command, Jest will automatically run as soon as it detects changes.
If you'd like, you can run `npm run start` and `npm run test` side by side so that you can preview changes and test them simultaneously.

# Creating a production build

When running the project with `npm run start`, we didn't end up with an optimized build.
Typically, we want the code we ship to users to be as fast and small as possible.
Certain optimizations like minification can accomplish this, but often take more time.
We call builds like this "production" builds (as opposed to development builds).

To run a production build, just run

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized JS and CSS build in `./build/static/js` and `./build/static/css` respectively.

You won't need to run a production build most of the time,
but it is useful if you need to measure things like the final size of your app.


# Ejecting

If at any point, you feel like there are certain customizations that the create-react-app setup has made difficult, you can always opt-out and get the various configuration options you need.
For example, if you'd like to add a Webpack plugin, it might be necessary to take advantage of the "eject" functionality that create-react-app provides.

Simply run

```sh
npm run eject
```

and you should be good to go!

As a heads up, you may want to commit all your work before running an eject.
You cannot undo an eject command, so opting out is permanent unless you can recover from a commit prior to running an eject.
